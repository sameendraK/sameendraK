- 👋 Hi, I’m @sameendraK.
- 👀 I am Angular developer with 2 YOE. I worked with ExpressJS in Backend. Also, I have done some projects in python,dJango,JavaScript,NodeJS,VueJs. Iam very keen on developing and deploying the applications. Seeking a new opportunity where I can do all of these things.
- 🌱 I have expereience in working in a Med Tech company named Meditab, whose clients are US based clinics. The product automates the flow from registration of the patient to the claims of the patient, everything at one place. Once a patient comes to the hosipatal, they are registered and attended by nurse to take vitals. Those vitals are recorded in the product and patients are kept in a waiting room. This status of the patient can be tracked using a screen called CICO. Once the doctor's visit is done, a list of medications which is given, can be faxed to the pharmacy near the patient's locality so that they can collect them on the go instead of waiting in a queue. After the vistt, they are given a superbill and also, they can track how many of thoses bills can be claiemd using the insurance. Also, once applied for claim, the status of the claims also can be tracked and there is also a mechansim to know if the claim may get rejected. So, we used a claim scrubbing which gives us the probability if the claim may be rejected. Many other complex functionalities are implemented in the projected such as delimiter search etc.
- 💞️ Second Project I have worked is for the nursing homes in US. Nursing homes are basically like a place where the elderly people are took care of and watched over to meet their daily essentials to daily routines. The project helps in automation of the main tasks in a nursing home. For example, if there are a set of tablets that are to be given, then our product can be leveraged to maintain a status check for those tablets which are given and which are not. So, this is useful when there are multiple nurse attending the patients and if multiple nurse give multiple tablets, the patient will be in overdose. So, to avoid this, we can use a tracking mechanism for the medication and mark them done if it is done. This is one of many examples.
